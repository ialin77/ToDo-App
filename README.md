# ToDo-App

ToDo App is a simple app where you can add your tasks to do.
For the ToDo App, I used Python for all functionalities, and the entire application was written in PyCharm.Also, during the realization of the project, I used the Djnago web framework to develop the project.

The only app of the project is called 'tasks' where I integrated the functionalities such as adding tasks, updating or deleting them, and marking as done if you complete that task.

Database
----------
For the database of this project, I used DB SQLite3 for storing all my data of the store.

Front end
-----------
For the front end of the store, I used Django templates where I stored the HTML, Django template tags, and language.
